# dx-mobile

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Setting it up

You'll need:
    - Flutter installation
    - an emulator (Android or iOS)
    - this repo

After installing Flutter, use Terminal or PowerShell and change directories to the dx-mobile directory you just cloned.

```$ cd dx-mobile ```

Then, launch any emulator. See the Flutter page for instructions on how to set up your emulators. As an example, if I have an emulator called iphonex, type this in your terminal:

```$ flutter emulators --launch iphonex ```

Once your emulator is running, run the app! Flutter should automatically get the dependencies and packages for you.

```$ flutter run ```
